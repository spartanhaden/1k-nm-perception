# Handheld 3D LiDAR scanner
This repo contains the CAD files for a handheld LiDAR scanner I made for fun.
<!-- Photogrametry and LiDAR reconstruction in the range of ~400-905 nm -->

<!-- Here is the BOM. I tried to keep the descriptions to minimun of what will work. If you want the exact parts I linked the McMaster Carr items I got. This will give you extras on many parts due to the quantity McMaster ships. -->

<!-- The design is still slightly unbalanced since I designed it with future expansion in mind and ordered some of the parts before determining the center of gravity for the current design. -->
